🧠 NLP Text Classification Model

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for building a text classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It leverages various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to classify text data effectively.

📁 Dataset
train.csv: Contains labeled text samples for training the model.

test.csv: Contains unlabeled text samples for evaluation or testing.

📌 Problem Statement
Build a model that can accurately classify text based on the training dataset. This involves cleaning the data, feature extraction, and training ML models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

🧰 Technologies & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Matplotlib, Seaborn

TfidfVectorizer

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MultinomialNB

🚀 Workflow
Data Loading & Exploration

Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation, stopwords

Tokenization and stemming

Vectorization using TF-IDF

Model Building & Evaluation
