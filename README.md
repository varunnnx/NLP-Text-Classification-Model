# 🧠 NLP Text Classification Model

This repository contains a complete pipeline for building a **text classification model** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and machine learning.

## 📂 Dataset

- `train.csv`: Labeled dataset with text and target class.
- `test.csv`: Unlabeled dataset for testing/prediction.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a model that classifies text into categories by performing preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Dataset structure, missing values
   - Label distribution

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Removal of punctuation, stopwords
   - Tokenization, Stemming

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

4. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

6. **Predictions on Test Data**

## 📈 Results

- Models evaluated on various metrics
- Performance visualized using confusion matrices and accuracy plots

## 📌 Future Scope

- Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Use ML pipelines and model deployment
